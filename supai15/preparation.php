The key to backpacking (and enjoying it) is to keep your backpack as light as possible. This means sacrificing some personal items (like hair gel, makeup, hand moisturizer, lip balms, fanny pack, high heels, etc). Only pack the things you really need. For a trip like Havasupai, your pack should weigh about 30lbs, without water. The following list will help you (don’t let the length of this document scare you, there really isn’t that much you need to bring).
<h4>Permits (Required): </h4>
First thing's first: Permits are $82/person and payable to Ryan. The land is owned by the Havasupai tribe, and visitors must make reservations and purchase permits to use the campgrounds. I have made reservations for our group to stay two nights (Thu, 5/28 and Fri, 5/29).
<h4>Backpack (Required)</h4>
Your Jansport backpack that you used in high school to carry books around is not going to cut it. You’re going to need a real backpack.
<h4>Tent and/or Hammock (Required):</h4> 
Because of the weather in Northern Arizona in late May, it is not uncommon for people to pack light and bring only a hammock, and no tent -- but this is your choice. Those who choose not to bring a tent run the risk of not finding a suitable location to tie up next to the group (hammocks require two conveniently distanced trees!). Tents also have the advantage of keeping warm at night, and acting as a good place to stash some of your gear... and your naked body while you change clothes. If you're planning to bring a tent, therefore, sleeping on the rocky ground, BRING A SLEEPING PAD!
<br>If purchasing a hammock, I would make sure the whole thing can pack down to double-fist size. Stick in the $60 range, unless you are trying to impress. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eagles-Nest-Outfitters-SingleNest-Hammock/dp/B001DDPG9I">This guy</a> has gotten me through the past 3 years.
<br>If purchasing a tent, aim for lightweight! Make sure sure it can fit in your pack with the rest of your gear.
<h4>Sleeping bag (Recommended).</h4> 
I have had experiences at Havasupai in late May when the nights were very cold, and I needed a sleeping bag AND long sleeves. Last year, I didn't use either. As the dates get closer, it would be wise to <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/l/Supai+AZ+USAZ0227:1:US">check the weather</a>.
If you do want to bring a sleeping bag, do not try and squeeze your $14.99 Walmart sleeping bag into your backpack. This just isn’t going to work. You are going to have to fork out some money to either buy one, or rent a bag that compresses. Remember, weight and size are critical to backpacking.
<h4>LED Headlamp (Required).</h4> 
Your camping lantern and 10 lbs Maglite is not going to work. Get a headlamp, and avoid being the annoying person who has to constantly be walking in the trail of someone who actually came prepared.
<h4>Shoes (Required): </h4>
Aside from a pair of sturdy boots/shoes (with ankle support) that you plan to hike in and out of the canyon in, you will need to bring a pair of shoes you don't mind getting wet. This can be an old pair of sneakers, or water shoes from REI. These need to be shoes, not flip-flops, that can stay firmly attached to your feet during a long day-hike through rugged terain.
<h4>Clothes (Required):</h4>
You can really cut down on a lot of weight by bringing less clothes.  In everyday life, it’s nice to put on new-fresh clothes every day…in the backpacking world, that is insane.  Bring on pair of shorts, a swim suit, 2 light-weight shirts (polyester or underarmor material works great), a long sleeve shirt for night,  3 pairs of good hiking socks. Don’t go cheap on socks, you don’t want blisters.  Flip flops, hat/bandana, large garbage bag (that you can use as a poncho if necessary).
<h4>Nalgene + Camelback (Required):</h4>
Water is critical for staying alive, but also for cooking, brushing your teeth, etc. There is a central water well station that everyone from the campground is allowed to use. It dispenses clean filtered water so bringing your own filter is not necessary. It is usually a decent hike's away from your campsite, so bringing along multi-gallon sized water bags is a great idea!
Stove, Gas, Pots, Pans – These things are required to cook your meals, but can be shared. If you don't already own them, I'd suggest teaming up with one other person. If you plan to share among a group any bigger, you may as well end up scheduling dinner at separate times of the evening :).
<h4>Food (Required):</h4> 
For breakfast, I like to bring oatmeal, granola bars, etc. For lunch, you'll likely be on the trail, so bring a lot of portable foods and don't expect to have your stove with you mid-day: Trail mix, protein bars, PB&J, etc. Mountain House dehydrated meals are great for dinner.
<h4>Drink (Required):</h4> Bring some gatorade powder.  This is necessary to add to the water (to give the water taste and also boost your electrolytes).  Bring a couple packets down.  There is no water from the  trailhead to the campgrounds, so basically 4 hours with no water.  On average, you would probably drink a full Gatorade bottle an hour.  Water/liquids will be the heaviest thing in your pack.  Don’t underestimate how much it weights (1 gallon of water is 8lbs).  You will want to have your Camelback hydration bladder filled (so you don’t have to stop to take off your backpack to drink).
<h4>Toiletries (Required):</h4>
Deodorant, tooth brush, tooth paste, small sunscreen (waterproof),  Chapstick, Vaseline or Baby Powder (optional), some toilet paper (optional). 
<h4>First Aid (Required): </h4>
One kit per every 4 or 5 people. Bandaids, Blister-Aids may be necessary for your feet (Greg). Advil.
<h4>Camera (optional):</h4>
Don’t forget extra batteries, and extra file space (you’ll take a lot of pictures).  Also, bring 2 heavy duty freezer ziplock bags to put your camera in.  These will keep your camera dry when we are jumping in and out of the water.
<h4>Plastic / Ziplock Bags (Required):</h4> 
Whatever it takes to keep your things dry. Trash bags are also required, as all trash must be packed back out of the campgrounds.

<h3><font color="green"><a name="checklist">Checklists</a></font></h3>
<a href="http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-checklist.html">Here</a> is a useful backpacking checklist from REI.
<br>
<br>
<h3><font color="green"><a name="faqs">FAQs</a></font></h3>
<h4>How many miles should I expect to hike?</h4>
From trailhead to campsite is ~10 miles.  Three of the four waterfalls are within two miles of the campsite; Havasupai Falls being the closet at a half mile or so depending where you camp.  Beaver Falls is almost four miles one way from the campsite and the Colorado River is over 8 miles one way.  The hike to those areas is some of the most beautiful in the area and not difficult.  You will have to traverse through the stream more than a few times.  In total if you at least visit all the falls, you will hike over 30 miles.  That's roughly the distance from the Alltel Ice Den in Scottsdale to the Coyotes Glendale Arena along the 101. 
<h4>How difficult is the return hike?</h4>
The first 8 miles is a very gradual walk up hill, only a couple degrees from level.  The last two miles on the other hand is absolute hell, more-so because you're carrying 30-40lbs of water and equipment (hopefully you ate all your food) on your back and gaining ~2700 feet.  Imagine hiking Camelback without climbing the rocks (the trail is "maintained").  Last summer, that ascent took me just under an hour.  I get the feeling most people in decent shape will take one and a half hours if not more. 
<h4>Activities?</h4>
Whatever makes your heart sing and put your mind to rest.  There are five major waterfalls, the Colorado River, old mines, side canyons, grottos and hideaways.  A few people do party late into the night.
<h4>Are bathrooms and other ammenities available at the campsite?</h4>
Yes. The campsite has several outhouse style restrooms available for campers. There are also wooden picnic tables at many of the campsites. ... but that's about it.
 <h4>Why should we hike in and out so early?</h4>
If you are able to hike through the canyon before ~10am, you will be in constant shade.  If you want to hike under a heat lamp, by all means wipe yourself out.  You will most likely want to nap after setting up camp, but once you see the waterfalls, you'll still want to take a nap, just by the water.  The hike out is the worst part of the trip.  You got your reward, now pay for it.  The last 1.5 miles are steep switch-backs gaining something like +2000 feet elevation.  Do this in the shade (early in the morning) and you'll make it out a lot happier and more comfortable, unless you get to the chopper.  Hope the winds don't prevent airlifts.  
<h4>How is the water?</h4>
The water is very mineralized, and is what has created the travertine steps that form the falls and pools.  This high mineral content also makes the water buoyant.  Imagine floating in the water only several yards from a water fall looking to the sky (if you wear contacts, the spray is unbearable too close).  As for the temperature, most people can only stay in the water 20-30 minutes at a time because it is so cold (high 60s maybe).  You get used to it, just jump in (easier said than done).  Finally, the water is drinkable.  There is a tap in the mountain at the campsite to fill water bottles.  I brought a water filter, and never used it except along the creek near the entrance to the village, which was probably unnecessary, but you never know. 
<h4>What would happen if I got hurt?</h4>
Don't.  Have you seen 127 Hours?  The Supai do have rangers to help you with minor injuries (bring your own first aid gear), but if you are incapacitated to the point of not being able to climb or hike out to the point immobility, a helicopter will be dispatched from Phoenix to pick you up and admit you into Flagstaff's hospital--at your expense!  
<h4>What do I do with my garbage?</h4>
Pack out your garbage!  There is no garbage truck or maid service.  Be a good steward to the environment and carry out your trash--and the looser's before you.  That includes your poop too!
<h4>Is there cellular service?</h4>
Fortunately, not really.  There are pockets where typically Verizon carriers can detect a signal.  So before you leave home, tell Aunt Cindy where you're going, leave enough food for Fido to survive for the weekend, and tell your significant other (assuming he or she is not cool enough to join the party) that you will NOT be calling home until you are back on the Route 66 driving home (yes, that's when you'll get service again).

<h3><font color="green"><a name="history">History of Havasupai  </a></font>(<a href="http://grandcanyonhistory.clas.asu.edu/history_nativecultures_havasupai.html">Source</a>)</h3>
Today, most of the Havasupai people, or the Havasu 'Baaja, live in Supai, a tributary canyon to Grand Canyon. But historically, they lived across a broader expanse, as far south as Bill Williams Mountain and east to the Little Colorado River. They moved up and down the vertical layers of the Grand Canyon, depending on seasons. During the fall and winter, they lived on the Colorado Plateau (the level of the Canyon’s rim), hunting and gathering food. In the spring and summer, Havasupai families farmed the Tonto Platform (including Indian Garden) and other arable areas, harvesting corn, beans, squash, melons and pumpkins. They did not encounter any European explorers until the Spanish priest Francisco Garcés traveled to Havasu Canyon in 1776. Garcés later traveled east to the Hopi mesas, and it is his report that tells of another Havasupai village as far east as Moencopi Wash, well beyond the Grand Canyon.
<br>
The Havasupai did not have to contend much with Euro-American intrusion until the late 1800s, when men looking for adventure or mineral riches traveled to the Canyon. These newcomers explored the landscape of the Grand Canyon by following trails of the Havasupai, Hopi, Cohoninas and Ancient Puebloans. The Euro-Americans, upon finding irrigation ditches and the remnants of cultivated fields on the Tonto Platform, named the area Indian Garden.
<br>
The Santa Fe Railroad opened a line to Grand Canyon in September of 1901. Two years later, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the canyon and rode down Bright Angel Trail. He met Yavñmi’ Gswedva (known as Big Jim to Anglos) and Billy Burro, two Havasupais who lived with their families at Indian Garden. Roosevelt told the Havasupai that a park was being created and they had to leave Indian Garden. Although Gswedva did as Roosevelt requested and moved his family out of Indian Garden to a cave higher up Bright Angel Trail, he continued to farm Indian Garden. Billy Burro and his wife, Tsoojva, remained at Indian Garden until the National Park Service forced them out in 1928.
<br>
For decades, the Havasupais were restricted to a 518-acre reservation in Havasu Canyon, part of their ancestral home. In 1975, Congress returned 185,000 acres of canyon and rim territory to the Havasupai Tribe. During the decades from the creation of the small Havasupai Reservation in 1882 and the enlargement in 1975, the Havasupai had to adjust the way they used their environment. More and more, they counted on farming, wage labor and tourism for survival.
